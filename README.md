# beetpx-npm-init-game

A tool for creating new [BeetPx](https://beetpx.dev) projects.

To use it, in your terminal navigate to the parent folder in which
you want to create your BeetPx game. Then run:

```shell
npm init @beetpx/beetpx-game@latest my-game
cd my-game
npm install
```

where `my-game` is your desired directory/project name.

To make sure things are working correctly, continue with:

```shell
npm run tsc
npm start
```

and the sample project should open in your web browser.
