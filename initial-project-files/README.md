The watch mode is enabled, meaning any change to the source code or assets
will make the webpage reload.

### `npm run prod`

it in a web browser.

### `npm run zip`

archive out of its files. Such package is ready to be used e.g. on https://itch.io .

### `npm run tsc`

Checks the project in term of its TypeScript types.

#### `npm run tsc:watch`

Similar to `npm run tsc`, but in a watch mode â€“ helpful

Typically, you would run `npm run tsc:watch` in a separate
terminal window, alongside `npm start.
